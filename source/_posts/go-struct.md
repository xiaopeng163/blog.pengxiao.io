### The Basic

Go does not have a concept of class, but it has `struct`. A struct is just like a simple class which only contain values.

The format of the definition of a `struct` is as follows:

```go
type identifier struct{
    filed1 type
    filed2 type
}
```

For example:

```go
type Person struct {
	Name string
	Age int
}
```

### Initialization

We can create an instance of our new Person type in a variety of ways:

```go
var p Person
```

This will create a local `Person` variable called `p`, and with a default zero value. For a struct zero means each of the fields is set to their corresponding zero value (0 for ints, 0.0 for floats, "" for strings, nil for pointers, â€¦)

We can also use the new function:

```go
p := new(Person)
```

This allocates memory for all the fields, sets each of them to their zero value and returns a pointer. More often we want to give each of the fields a value. We can do this in two ways. Like this:

```go
p := Person{Name: "Jim", Age: 21}
```

Or we can leave off the field names if we know the order they were defined:

```go
c := Person{"Jim", 21}
```
